\section{Introduction}

Tarski's theorem states that a monotone function on a complete lattice has a
complete lattice of fixed points, in particular a least and greatest. A useful
class of special cases are powerset lattices ordered by inclusion.

\section{Powerset Lattices}

Let $X$ be a set, not necessarily empty, and let $\wp{X}$ be the set of all
subsets of $X$. The set $\wp{X}$ forms a complete lattice under set inclusion,
with meets given by intersection and joins given by union. That is, if
$\mathcal{X}\subset\wp{X}$, then $\bigcap{\mathcal{X}}$ is its meet (greatest lower bound) and
$\bigcup{\mathcal{X}}$ is its join (least upper bound). The least element is the join
of the empty set, namely $\emptyset$, and the greatest element is the meet of the empty
set, namely $X$.

A function $F:\wp{X}\to\wp{X}$ is \emph{monotone} if it preserves inclusion: if
$A\subseteq B\subseteq X$, then $F(A)\subseteq F(B)\subseteq X$. For monotone $F$ on
$\wp{X}$, a \emph{pre-fixed point} of $F$ is a set $A\subseteq X$ such that
$F(A)\subseteq A$, and a \emph{post-fixed point} of $F$ is a set $A\subseteq X$ such that
$X\subseteq F(X)$. A pre-fixed point of $F$ is also said to be \emph{$F$-closed} and a post-fixed
point of $F$ is said to be \emph{$F$-consistent}.  A \emph{least pre-fixed point} of a
monotone $F$ is the \emph{smallest} (with respect to containment) $F$-closed set, and a
\emph{greatest post-fixed point} of $F$ is the \emph{largest} (with respect to
containment) $F$-consistent set.

Viewing the lattice as a (skinny) )category, a monotone function $F$ on it is a
\emph{functor}, a pre-fixed point of it is an \emph{$F$-algebra} and a post-fixed point of
it is an \emph{$F$-coalgebra}. Thus, a \emph{least} pre-fixed point of $F$ is an
\emph{initial $F$-algebra} and a \emph{greatest} post-fixed point of $F$ is a \emph{final
  $F$-coalgebra}.

If $L\subseteq X$ is a least pre-fixed point of a monotone $F$, then $L$ is a \emph{fixed point}
of $F$, which is to say $F(L)=L$. Given that $F(L)\subseteq L$, it is enough to show that
$L\subseteq F(L)$. Now with $L$ being the meet of all pre-fixed points of $F$, it suffices to show
that $F(L)$ is a pre-fixed point of $F$. But by monotonicity of $F$ we have
$F(F(L))\subseteq F(L)\subseteq L$.  (Categorially, an initial algebra for a functor is an isomorphism.)

By duality if $M\subseteq X$ is a greatest post-fixed point of $F$, then $M$ is also a fixed point
of $F$. (Categorially, a final co-algebra for a functor is an isomorphism.)

Every monotone $F:\wp{X}\to\wp{X}$ has a (unique) least pre-fixed point and (unique) greatest
post-fixed point, given by the equations
\begin{align*}
  \mu(F) & = \bigcap\{\,A\subseteq X\,\mid\, F(A)\subseteq A\,\} \\
  \nu(F) & = \bigcup\{\,A\subseteq X\,\mid\,A\subseteq F(A)\,\}
\end{align*}
By the previous remarks these are, respectively, the least and greatest fixed
points of $F$.

It is evident that $\mu(F)$ is contained in all pre-fixed points of $F$, being
their intersection.  It remains to show that $F(\mu(F))\subseteq \mu(F)$.  Being the
greatest lower bound of all pre-fixed points, it is enough to show that if
$F(A)\subseteq A$, then $F(\mu(F))\subseteq A$.  If $F(A)\subseteq A$, then $\mu(F)\subseteq A$ by definition, and
so by monotonicity $F(\mu(F))\subseteq F(A)\subseteq A$, and we are done.

Similarly, $\nu(F)$ contains all post-fixed points of $F$, it being their union,
and, arguing dually to the preceding, $\nu(F)$ is itself a post-fixed point of
$F$.  It is thus the greatest post-fixed point, and hence a fixed point.

The least fixed point of a monotone $F$ on $\wp{X}$ is that it affords the following
\emph{induction principle}: to show that $\mu(F)\subseteq A$, it suffices to show that
$F(A)\subseteq A$, which is to say that $A$ is $F$-closed.  Similarly, the greatest post-fixed
point, $\nu(F)$, of $F$ affords the following \emph{coinduction principle}: to show that
$A\subseteq \nu(F)$, it suffices to show that $A\subseteq F(A)$, which is to say that $A$ is $F$-consistent.

Re-phrased in terms of predicates and implication, the least fixed point of a monotone $F$
is the \emph{strongest} property $A$ of elements of $X$ such that if $x\in F(A)$, then
$x\in A$.  Thus, to show that $x\in\mu(F)$ implies $x\in A$, it is enough to show that if
$x\in F(A)$, then $x\in A$.  A dual characterization applies to the greatest fixed point.

It is also possible to show that the meet and join of any set of fixed points of a
monotone function is itself a fixed point, but this seems not to be as useful as the
construction of a least and greatest.
